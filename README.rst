=========
SuSiE-PCA
=========

    SuSiE PCA is a scalable Bayesian variable selection technique for sparse principal component analysis


SuSiE PCA is the abbreviation for the sum of single effects model in principal component analysis. We develop SuSiE PCA
for an efficient variable selection in PCA when dealing with high dimensional data with sparsity, and for quantifying
uncertainty of contributing features for each latent component through posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs). We
implement the model with the `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_ library developed by Google which enable the fast
training on CPU, GPU or TPU.


Install SuSiE PCA
=================
The source code for SuSiE PCA is written fully in python 3.8 with JAX (see
`JAX installation guide <https://github.com/google/jax#installation>`_ for JAX). Follow the code provided below to quickly
get started using SuSiE PCA. Users can clone this github repository and install the SuSiE PCA.

.. code:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:mancusolab/susiepca.git
   cd susiepca
   pip install -e .



Get Started with Example
========================

1. Create a python environment in the cloned repository, then simply import the SuSiE PCA

.. code:: python

   import susiepca as sp

2. Generate a simulation data set according to the description in **Simulation** section from our paper. $Z_{N \\times K}$
   is the simulated factors matrix, $W_{K \\times P}$ is the simulated loading matrix, and the $X_{N \\times P}$ is the
   simulation data set that has $N$ observations with $P$ features.

.. code:: python

   Z, W, X = sp.sim.generate_sim(seed = 0, l_dim = 40, n_dim = 150, p_dim =200, z_dim = 4, effect_size = 1)

3. Input the simulation data set into SuSiE PCA with $K=4$ and $L=40$, or you can manipulate with those two parameters
   to check the model mis-specification performance. The max iteration is set to be 200, and here we use the principal
   components extracted from traditional PCA results as the initialization of mean of $Z$.

.. code:: python

   results = sp.infer.susie_pca(X, z_dim = 4, l_dim = 40, init = "pca", max_iter=200)

The returned "results" contain 5 different objects:

- params: an dictionary that saves all the updated parameters from the SuSiE PCA.
- elbo_res: the value of evidence lower bound (ELBO) from the last iteration.
- pve: a length $K$ ndarray contains the percent of variance explained (PVE) by each component.
- pip: the $K$ by $P$ ndarray that contains the posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) of each feature contribution to the factor.
- W: the posterior mean of loading matrix which is also a $K$ by $P$ ndarray.

4. To examine the model performance, one straitforward way is to draw and compare the heatmap of the true loading matrix
   and estimate loading matrix using seaborn:

.. code:: python

   import seaborn as sns

   # specify the palatte for heatmap
   div = sns.diverging_palette(250, 10, as_cmap=True)

   # Heatmap of true loading matrix
   sns.heatmap(W, cmap = div, fmt = ".2f",center = 0)

   # Heatmap of estimate loading matrix
   W_hat = results.W
   sns.heatmap(W_hat, cmap = div, fmt = ".2f", center = 0)

   # Heatmap of PIPs
   pip = results.pip
   sns.heatmap(pip, cmap = div, fmt = ".2f", center = 0)

To mathmatically compute the Procrustes error of the estimate loading matrix, you need to install the Procruste package
to solve the rotation problem (see `procrustes installation guide <https://procrustes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usr_doc_installization.html>`_
for Procrustes method). Then one can compute the Procrustes error as following:

.. code:: python

   import procrutes
   import numpy as np

   # perform procruste transformation
   proc_trans_susie = procrustes.orthogonal(np.asarray(W_hat.T), np.asarray(W.T), scale=True)
   print(f"The Procrustes error for the loading matrix is {proc_trans_susie.error}")

You can also calculate the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) to assess the model prediction performance

.. code:: python

   from susiepca import metrics

   # compute the predicted data
   X_hat = results.params.mu_z @ W_hat

   # compute the RRMSE
   rrmse_susie = metrics.mse(X, X_hat)

5. Finally we also provide the function to compute a $\\rho-$ level credible set

.. code:: python

   cs = sp.metrics.get_credset(results.params, rho=0.9)

Notes
=====

`JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_ uses 32-bit precision by default. To enable 64-bit precision before calling
`susiepca` add the following code:

.. code:: python

   import jax
   jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)

Similarly, the default computation device for `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_ is set by environment variables
(see `here <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#faq-data-placement>`_). To change this programmatically before
calling `susiepca` add the following code:

.. code:: python

   import jax
   platform = "gpu" # "gpu", "cpu", or "tpu"
   jax.config.update("jax_platform_name", platform)
